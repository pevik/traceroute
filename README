This is a new modern implementation of the traceroute(8)
utility for Linux systems.

Traceroute tracks the route packets take across an IP network on their
way to a given host. It utilizes the IP protocol's time to live (TTL)
field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each
gateway along the path to the host.

Features list includes:
- Full support for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
- Several tracerouting methods, using
  * UDP datagrams
  * ICMP ECHO packets
  * TCP SYN requests
- UDP method does not require root privileges
- Ability to send several probe packets at a time
- performing AS path lookups for returned addresses
- command line compatible with the original traceroute
- and much more...

This code was written from the scratch, using some ideas of
Olaf Kirch's traceroute, the original implementation of Van Jacobson
(which was long used before) and some current BSD's ones.

This traceroute requires Linux kernel 2.6 and higher.

Good tracerouting!
